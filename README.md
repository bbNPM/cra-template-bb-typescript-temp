### Structure
![alt text](https://github.com/BananaBb/cra-template-bb-react-temp/blob/main/typescript.structure?raw=true)

### Assets/
The assets folder contains images and global scss folder for styling. In this project architecture, I am using centralized styling with SCSS files. I am more comfortable with that.

### Components/
The components folder contains a collection of UI components like button, custom input field, modal, etc that will be shared and used across files in the project.
Each component has a test file to help us maintain them because they used widely in the project.

### Pages/
The pages folder reflects the routes of the application. Each component inside this folder has its own route.

### Utils/
The utils folder is just a place to locate some utility functions that used repeatedly in the project. Files in the utils folder should only contain some functions like date formatting, string conversion, etc.
